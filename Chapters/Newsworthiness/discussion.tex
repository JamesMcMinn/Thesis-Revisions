\section{Conclusion}
\label{scoring:sec:discussion}

In this chapter, we proposed a newsworthiness scoring approach that uses a set of heuristics to automatically label content and learn term likelihood ratios to produce Newsworthiness Scores for tweets in real-time.
We evaluated its classification and scoring effectiveness on the Events 2012 corpus and found that it was able to distinguish between content related to real-world events and noise.
Automatic evaluation on the Events 2012 corpus showed that by using Newsworthiness as a feature to filter out noisy clusters, we could significantly improve the effectiveness of a simple cluster-based event detection approach, achieving significant improvements to precision with only slight decreases to recall.
Finally, a manual evaluation suggests that high newsworthiness scores can be extremely effective at filtering out noise, and we achieved precision values of 0.950 on clusters as small as 5 tweets, and perfect precision with as few as 50.
