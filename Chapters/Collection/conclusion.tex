\section{Conclusion}

\label{collection:sec:conclusion}
In this chapter, we described the creation of a new corpus for evaluation of event detection approaches on Twitter.
We examined current definitions of event, and proposed a new definition which better fits the characteristics of Twitter.
We proposed a methodology for the creation of a large-scale event detection corpora using state-of-the-art event detection approaches, and the Wikipedia Current Events Portal to create a pool of events.
We then use crowdsourcing to generate relevance judgements for the pool of events.
We then propose a method of merging events from different sources, so that the final events fit our definition of event.
We discuss the quality of the results obtained, and note a number of areas which merit further investigation.
We make the corpus, which contains 120 million Twitter, and relevance judgements for 150,000 tweets covering more than 500 events, available for further research and development.
