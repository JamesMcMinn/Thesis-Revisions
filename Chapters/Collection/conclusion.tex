\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\label{collection:sec:conclusion}
In this chapter, we propose a methodology for the creation of a large-scale collection for the evaluation of event detection approaches, and use it to create such a collection.
We propose a new definition of event that better fits the characteristics of events on Twitter.
We then describe our methodology for the creation of a large-scale event detection collection, using state-of-the-art event detection approaches, and the Wikipedia Current Events Portal to create a pool of events.
We then use crowdsourcing to generate relevance judgements for the pool of events.
We then propose a method of merging events from different sources, so that the final events fit our definition of event.
We discuss the quality of the results obtained, and note a number of areas which merit further investigation.

We make the corpus, which contains 120 million tweets, and relevance judgements for 150,000 tweets and over 500 events, available for further research and development: \texttt{http://mir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/}.
