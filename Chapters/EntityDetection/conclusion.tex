\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we proposed a novel, efficient and real-time event detection technique, which uses named entities to partition a stream of incoming tweets and perform clustering.
We showed how a lightweight burst detection scheme can be used effectively to detect bursty entities, and how semantic links can be formed between bursting entities to describe real-world events.
We performed what we believe was the first in-depth analysis of an event detection approach for Twitter, using a large-scale collection of 120 million tweets and over 500 events.
We validated our hypothesis using the collection and through crowdsourcing, showing that our approach makes significant improvements over two state-of-the-art baselines and performed in-depth analysis of the results.
Finally, we described a number of issues with automatic evaluation of event detection on Twitter and describe a number of possible solutions.
